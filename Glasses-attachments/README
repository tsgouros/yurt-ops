	I attached the latest stl models that I could find (in old email chains).
	We usually had to print the parts slightly scaled up (~103%) to accommodate for material shrinkage in 3D printing.

	If you need to make edits I can also dig up the original Blender models, though that would have to wait until I'm back home from the office.

	Cheers,
	Johannes
